In the wine industry, assessing quality is crucial for determining market value, aligning with consumer 
preferences, and ensuring the success of a wine product. This project utilized the Wine Quality Dataset, 
which contains physicochemical properties and sensory quality data for red wines, to build a classification 
model for predicting wine grades. The report explored both glassbox models such as shallow Decision Trees, 
and blackbox models like LightGBM, comparing their interpretability and performance. Additionally, SHAP 
(SHapley Additive exPlanations) was applied to tree-based blackbox models to provide insights into feature 
importance at both the global and local levels. This analysis aimed to identify a balance between model 
accuracy and interpretability for practical applications in wine quality prediction.
